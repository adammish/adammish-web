the screen door  
never  
fully closed  
and the  
bugs come in  

and it's been a while since  
this fire has burned so low  
so blue so concentrated so  
nearly out and yet radiating  
the hottest heat&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heat  
from the very core heat that  
is omniscient heat from sliced  
atoms heat without judgment  

and besides  
I don't really  
mind the bugs and  
the breeze  
feeds the fire
