title: any room for poems

sometimes I wonder  
if there's any  
room  
for poems  
in this joyful head and body  

after all the sad ones  
and songs  
and all the hardship  

can poems shine in  
waves and lap on the  
shores  
where they  
hit my feet  
and I paint  
them or just report  
what I saw?
