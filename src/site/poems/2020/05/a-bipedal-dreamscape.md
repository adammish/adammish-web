it races towards the front  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the mind  

“how was your day?”  

then it moves  
into the  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heat of your core  
a bipedal dreamscape  
past aching legs  

“good, how was yours?”  

the entire force of  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;itself  

tapping your foot  
and rubbing your eyes
