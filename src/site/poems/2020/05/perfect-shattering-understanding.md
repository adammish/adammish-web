it's quiet in here  

well actually  
it's not  
but we're  
acting as though it is  

passing like  
ships  

but not ships in  
the night  

we're passing like  
ships in the  
early dawn  

standing at the bow  
in  
perfect&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shattering  
understanding  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the  
other
