title: where one is found

the rain puddles  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are desperate  
to reach their  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hands  
through my shoes  
and  
I urge them on  

one  
step  
at  
a time  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;avoiding dry land  
at all cost  

dry land is where they find you  

dry land is where one is found
