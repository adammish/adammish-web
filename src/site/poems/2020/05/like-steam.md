title: like steam

somtimes I take  
the short walk  
from the  
office to an old church  

scuffing my bootheels visions  
of sounds a  
city doesn't  
make on its own  

and colors  

and people without  
shoes on  
bolted down benches  

I go in the  
church and  
pray like steam  

a tortured peace
