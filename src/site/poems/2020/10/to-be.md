to be here  
with you  
with nothing to do  
and nowhere to be

to experience  
as the stars  
and the moon do  
in their own time

to float like  
dandelion seeds  
and to land  
in the mud

to exhale  
like the ocean  
breeze pushes on  
sand dunes

to stand firm  
neither for  
nor against  
ourselves

to be
