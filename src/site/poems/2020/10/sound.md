it's hour three  
of the siren going off  
like an ice cream truck  
from hell

and the train goes by  
and the train whistle  
screams into the morning air

and cars  
windows down  
radio blasting  
go by

and squirrels chatter  
and the refrigerator moans

and the highway  
far off  
whispers the rise  
and fall  
of civilization

and I have  
some coffee  
and breakfast

and I am  
sitting next to  
the second story window

and I am  
not making a  
sound
