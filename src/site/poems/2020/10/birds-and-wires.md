yes  
I see the birds  
and wires

and I know  
you tried to be  
free

my hands are  
raw  
with trying

but inside this  
apartment  
we're really  
getting somewhere

the chains are ashamed  
of themselves

our birds are  
singing our song

Leonard  
I think you'd  
approve of all this

of what we've got  
goint on here
