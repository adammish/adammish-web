echoes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all echoes  
and no noise  

when I sat on the bed  
and couldn’t say a thing  
and couldn’t get my arm right  
when you walked in and out  
but didn’t say a thing  
because nothing is wrong  
and nothing is wrong  
and nothing is wrong  
and nothing is wrong  
and besides&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you giggled  
looking off  
I said  
what is it?  
you said  
nothing
