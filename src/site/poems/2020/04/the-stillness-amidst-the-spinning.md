title: the stillness amidst the spinning

I heard the crinkle  
of the paper bag and then  
the sound of glass  
on Uncle Jerry's dining room table  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me my father and him  
all around it  
and the light was dull and  
the walls  
didn't match the mood  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two men and a teenager  
shot for shot for a number of shots  
that nobody could remember&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my father left  
first and went upstairs to bed  
never quite tripping  
never quite landing his feet where he intended them  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncle Jerry  
several shots later lay asleep  
or something like it  
under his dining room table  
and the light  
and the walls of the room  
didn’t change  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sat there alone  
victorious&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but only just  
and I saw the door  
that led to the kitchen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;everything spinning  
until it all became very still&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aware  
of the stillness amidst the spinning&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very aware  
I was the last one awake  
which I usually liked&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but tonight  
I understood it in a different way

&nbsp;

24 years later  
Uncle Jerry's dining room table is mine

and now I sit at it  
last one at the table  
after dinner&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drinking a beer  
getting to the bottom  
Kiddo playing with his toys  
under Uncle Jerry's old table

another? 

but tonight  
just one beer tonight  
just one  
tonight
