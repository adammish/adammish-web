I have a padlock

I don’t remember the combination

it isn’t locking anything

I keep it in a cloth bag&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and rarely think of it  
until I need something in the bag  
and I see it  
and wonder  
and wonder&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;why I don’t just throw it out  
since I don’t remember how to open it  
since&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it does nothing  

but I never throw it out  
it goes back&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the bag  

to wait&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for me  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to remember
