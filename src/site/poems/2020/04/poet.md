I don't have a desk  

if I did I'd be writing at it

but I don't&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so I'm in bed  
on a mattress&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the floor  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in an empty room  
except for the elliptical  
which came with the room  
which I've hung my 3 shirts on

I'm writing in bed  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it's past 3 am and the  
smoke floats up towards the light

if I want to be a  
poet I should at least have a desk

but I am in bed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alone this time  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while you sleep 3 rooms away
