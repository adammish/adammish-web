hey  
I know itâ€™s been a while  
the clouds are making this  
design  
on the wall as the sun goes  
through them and then the  
leaves  
throw their design on top  
and the same sun through my  
tea  
makes a rainbow if you let  
your eyes unfocus a little  
please  
just let your eyes unfocus  
a little every now and then
